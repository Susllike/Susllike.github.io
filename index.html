		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center;">Below are the projects I have done over the years.</p>
		<div class="grid-container">
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #1</h3>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/0BJ56JTe4i0" target="_blank"><p>Parallel Parking LEGO Car</p>
				<img src="images/park-assist.png"></a>
				<p>The oldest recorded project that I have ever participated in - a parallel parking LEGO car. My dad was in charge of the code, and I was responsible for the implementation of the system into the car.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #2</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19eE7hKf5n42PpkCjz6QADRlXWgZWPgN3/view" target="_blank"><p>Wooden Toy Project</p>
				<img src="images/wooden-toy.jpg"></a>
				<p class="project-description">One of the first engineering projects I have worked on in high school. This weird looking thing was initially supposed to be a man doing push-ups, but he "evolved backwards" into a box with wings. This project tested the skills of designing, 3D modeling, and laser cutting.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #3</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F4ZHl0otekt8Bwl4lzuK7ltO1xIBXvH_/view" target="_blank"><p>Reverse Engineering Project</p>
				<img src="images/reverse-engineering-toy.png"></a>
				<p class="project-description">This project was about 3D modeling a given toy by making a series of precise measurements of the parts which would later be used for those parts' digital representations. Our team got the hardest toy from the batch, and while it was quite challenging to go through, this project left me with a highly improved skill of 3D modeling.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #4</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10j574Shf4Ac8GQXP30-DfVat8UOCiSy0/view" target="_blank"><p>Artificial Heart Valve Project</p>
				<img src="images/heart-valve.png"></a>
				<p class="project-description">Our engineering design class got a chance to work with another class - Principles of Biomedical Science (PBS). We, engineers, were tasked with creating a functional prototype of a heart valve that would later be tested by the PBS students on a real heart. Unfortunately, due to severe lack of communication, we never found out whether our valve was actually functioning within a heart. Nevertheless, we got to model a complicated object and test our abilties in creating simple, yet efficient designs.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #5</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O-ngKb4HxcUcAt4vmKdlnZufFSRa7HgC/view" target="_blank"><p>Happy Meal Toy Project</p>
				<img src="images/happy-meal-toy.jpg"></a>
				<p class="project-description">Our team got to create a toy for a new McDonald's toy collection, given that it had to be something from a Disney Franchise. We went with Stewie from Family Guy, and the result was... interesting. This project tested our 3D modeling skills to the limits, but we were successful in the end.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #6</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bG3t2BqtsLqSv0gmfid5Ts5iO-D58dTy/view" target="blank"><p>VEX Car Wash Project</p>
				<img src="images/car-wash-design.jpg"></a>
				<p class="project-description">This project was about designing one of the given systems from VEX Robotics parts running on RobotC programming language - our team got to build a "car wash". This was the first serious hardware/software mix for me personally, and I'm really glad we were successful in finishing this build.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #7</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usTTIJW0r-mfYE5B6v4JqLkvCXfn-KLv/view" target="_blank"><p>Hubble Video Project</p>
				<img src="images/hubble-telescope.jpg"></a>
				<p class="project-description">This project was about researching a certain aerospace industry achievement and creating a video about it - me and my partner decided to go with the Hubble Telescope. Personally grew a little bit in the video editing skill.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #8</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XbK71oxdxy6I_InIHCSpl6JKUEl47WXT/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><p>Airfoil Design Project</p>
				<img src="images/airfoil.png"></a>
				<p class="project-description">Me and my partner were tasked to design an airfoil with some extensive initial constraints and other useful information. We had to use an airfoil simulator and a lot of equations to come up with our unique airfoil that fulfilled all of the requirements. Was it the most efficient airfoil? No. But it's still pretty good, and that is what matters.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #9</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h5AHluCLFO9Zr8DPV82hXnU_ImmkUdLT/view" target="_blank"><p>Glider Design Project</p>
				<img src="images/glider.jpg"></a>
				<p class="project-description">For this solo project, I had to design and create a simple glider, and then modify it along the way to achieve the longest distance possible. I went with an interseting route of creating modifications with extra balsa wood instead of something like paper, and that route was also quite extensive - I went for 8 trials of 10 throws each instead of the initial 3 trials. The glider worked pretty well in the end, so my high effort was technically worth it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h3>Project #10</h3>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i1AlPAmeMUa8wT_O9LmIe7mull4BNiYK/view" target="_blank"><p>Sizing Up the Universe Video Project</p>
				<img src="images/solar-system-scale.jpg"></a>
				<p class="project-description">This project was about understanding the massive scale of space and showing it in some meaningful way. I decided to go with juggling balls as planets and my school's football field as vast space. Got some practice with video editing along the way as well.</p>

		<h2>Resume</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center;">You can find my resume right <a href="engineering-resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I assume you have already seen all of my work before going here, right? If not, then I guess you just want to know me in general. The technical stuff is left for the resume, below is everything else:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2003, moved to Pleasanton, CA in 2017, has been living there since</li>
				<li>Was a memeber of the airplane making club for three years</li>
				<li>Took a PLTW engineering class for every school year since moving, plan on doing that until graduation</li>
				<li style="list-style: square inside;">The plan is to take more engineering classes even after high school</li>
				<li>Like disasembling and re-assembling things to learn how they work</li>
				<li>Going with learning, I like a hands-on approach the most. An example of doing stuff with your own hands: I've fixed a lamp with the cord from a vacuum cleaner, and I still have that lamp - isn't that cool?</li>
				<li>Can spend quite a while optimizing something if I feel like it is worth doing</li>
				<li>18 years old</li>
				<li>7' or ~2.13m tall, and no, I don't play basketball (yet?)</li>
				<li>Can wiggle my ears and juggle - sometimes even at the same time!</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p id="clock"></p>
		<h3>Clock is ticking.</h3>
		<h3>I am a senior in high school right now. The clock above shows how much time I have left before graduating and technically becoming an adult. Before that happens, I am not a particularly busy individual, so I have a lot of free time on hands to learn and achieve many different things. Short-terms goals at the moment:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Look for and apply to colleges - I have decided to go with mechatronics, plus potentially mixing in some economics.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Some dream stuff:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You know those engineering YouTubers? Mark Rober, Shane from Stuff Made Here, Colin Furze, Hacksmith, and many-many-many others - all of them are an inspiration to just be a creative engineer with a unique personality, making and showing stuff to the world on YouTube. Right now, I don't have the ability to do much of anything engineering related within my own apartment, so, until a better situiation - get good at theoretical stuff to eventually be good a practical stuff and be impressive.</li>
			<li>Obviously, dreaming too big has its drawbacks, but the safety net can be dreaming at an even bigger scale :) The world is not perfect - there are many problems to fix, and it would be amazing to solve one of the big ones, and preferrably the one closely related to engineering.</li>
			<li>The least ambitious dream of mine at this point is to get a good engineering job (something in the mechanical/electrical disciplines), and just be good at it. Nothing too specific here.</li>
