			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I assume you have already seen all of my work before going here, right? If not, then I guess you just want to know about me. Here we go then - starting with technical things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML, CSS, a little bit of JS, Python</li>
				<li>Autodesk Inventor</li>
				<li>3D printing</li>
				<li>Robotics - particularly with VEX kits</li>
				<li>Google Suite</li>
				<li>English, Russian, some ASL and a tiny bit of French</li>
				<li>Engineering classes taken: Introduction to Engineering Design, Honors Principles of Engineering, Honors Aerospace Engineering</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that the skill set and other things are out of the way, here is me in general:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2003, moved to Pleasanton, CA in 2017, has been living there since</li>
				<li>Joined the airplane making club for three years, left after losing interest - really regret leaving</li>
				<li>Took a PLTW engineering class for every school year since moving, plan on doing that until graduation</li>
				<li style="list-style: square inside;">The plan is to take more engineering classes even after high school</li>
				<li>Like disasembling and re-assembling things to see how they work</li>
				<li>Going with learning, I like a hands-on approach the most</li>
				<li>Can spend quite a while optimizing something if I feel like it is worth doing</li>
				<li>17 years old</li>
				<li>6'11" or ~2.11m tall, and no, I don't play basketball</li>
				<li>Can juggle and wiggle my ears - sometimes even at the same time!</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p id="clock"></p>
		<h3>Clock is ticking.</h3>
		<h3>I am a junior in high school right now. The clock above represents how much time I have left before graduating and technically becoming an adult. Before that happens, I am not a particularly busy individual, so I have a lot of time on hands to learn and achieve many different things. These are the short-terms ones that come to mind:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn some advanced physics during the summer - engineers rely on physics, and the more you know it, the better</li>
			<li>Get extensive practice of 3D modeling - there are many detailed pages of various parts that can be a good modeling practice, and I definitely need to improve that skill a lot if I intend to pursue engineering seriously</li>
			<li>Get a personal Arduino set over the summer and build some projects with it - good practice with electrical engineering and coding</li>
			<li>The Arduino goal will help with potentially finishing the Foothill Moving Couch project - it has many different aspects in it, electrical one being the most sophisticated along with the codebase. If successful, you'll find it here :)</li>
			<li>Research different engineering disciplines in exstensive details to understand what various engineers actually do</li>
			<li>Make a short list of the most compelling disciplines; right now those are:</li>
			<li style="list-style: square inside;">Mechanical Engineering - a little bit of everything from the engineering world, and I like being competent in absolutely everything</li>
			<li style="list-style: square inside;">Electrical Engineering - electricty and circuits are literally everywhere today, it's good to know how this stuff works</li>
			<li style="list-style: square inside;">Computer Engineering? - computers are also a pretty big thing in today's world, but this discipline seems a bit too focused for me.</li>
			<li>Look for colleges??? - all this secondary education mess is very intimidating and complicated, but it has to be dealt with at some point...</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Some dream stuff:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You know those engineering YouTubers? Mark Rober, Shane from Stuff Made Here, Colin Furze, Hacksmith, and many-many-many others - all of them are an inspiration to just be a creative engineer with a unique personality, making and showing stuff to the world on YouTube. Right now, I don't have the ability to do much of anything engineering related within my own apartment, so, until a better situiation - get good at theoretical stuff to eventually be good a practical stuff and be impressive.</li>
			<li>Obviously, dreaming too big has its drawbacks, but the safety net can be dreaming at an even bigger scale :) The world is not perfect - there are many problems to fix, and it would be amazing to solve one of the big ones, and preferrably the one closely related to engineering.</li>
			<li>The least ambitious dream of mine at this point is to get a good engineering job (something in the mechanical/electrical disciplines), and just be good at it. Nothing too specific here - I will have to reserver a full day or two just thinking about future and other things to start figuring something out properly.</li>
