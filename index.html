			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I assume you have already seen all of my work before going here, right? If not, then I guess you just want to know about me. Here we go then - starting with technical things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML, CSS, a little bit of JS, Python</li>
				<li>Autodesk Inventor</li>
				<li>3D printing</li>
				<li>Robotics - particularly with VEX kits</li>
				<li>Google Suite</li>
				<li>English, Russian, some ASL and a tiny bit of French</li>
				<li>Engineering classes taken: Introduction to Engineering Design, Honors Principles of Engineering, Honors Aerospace Engineering</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that the skill set and other things are out of the way, here is me in general:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2003, moved to Pleasanton, CA in 2017, has been living there since</li>
				<li>Joined the airplane making club for three years, left after losing interest - really regret leaving</li>
				<li>Took a PLTW engineering class for every school year since moving, plan on doing that until graduation</li>
				<li style="list-style: square inside;">The plan is to take more engineering classes even after high school</li>
				<li>Like disasembling and re-assembling things to see how they work</li>
				<li>Going with learning, I like a hands-on approach the most</li>
				<li>Can spend quite a while optimizing something if I feel like it is worth doing</li>
				<li>17 years old</li>
				<li>6'11" or ~2.11m tall, and no, I don't play basketball</li>
				<li>Can juggle and wiggle my ears - sometimes even at the same time!</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p id="clock"></p>
		<p>Clock is ticking.</p>
		<p>I am a junior in high school right now. The clock above represents how much time I have left before graduating and technically becoming an adult.</p>
		<p>Do I know what I will be doing after this timer runs out? Well, my plan is to go to college, but there is nothing much besides that.</p>
